Object Oriented Programming
------------------------------
Opps is a structure where we can bunddle some set of similar properties and methods
-> To write reusable codes using classes and objects is called OOP.

class
-----
This is a user defined datatype, which specifies the properties and functionalities to be storesd.
Here we are specifing the base/ intial data/ properties and functionalities to  storesd
we define a class using 'class' keywod.

Syntax:
class ClassName:
    data / properties / states
    functionalities / methods/ behaviours


inside a class first we have write all the properties, then only we can define our menthod


Ex:
class Car:
    color = 'red'
    wheels = 4

    def start(self):
        print('started')

    def stop(self):
        print('stopped')


Object
------
Object is a real world entity consists of some data and menthods
-> It is an instance of a class, it will have all the properties and functionalities of that class

we can intialize object by calling the class name.

Syntax:
object_name = ClassName()

when ever we intialize an object, will copy all the properties and methods from class.


Ex:
nano = Car()
